      <title>Variant analysis of the &#39;Sequoia&#39; bug</title>

      <description>I imagine we&amp;rsquo;ve all heard about the recent &amp;ldquo;Sequoia&amp;rdquo; bug discovered by the Qualys Research team, identified by CVE-2021-33909. It&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating bug caused by a size_t to int conversion. According to the analysis, seq_dentry attempts to convert a size_t to an int by sending size_t size to the dentry_path function, which expects a signed integer. Assuming the architecture is 32 bits, size_t&amp;rsquo;s value can be 0 to 4294967296 since it is unsigned, but int can only hold from -2147483648 to 2147483648 because it is signed (this means that it can have negative values also).</description>

      <title>A story about an Apple and two fetches</title>

      <description>Mistreatment by Apple Security is unfortunately something you&amp;rsquo;re likely to come across on a regular basis. Usually this concerns people that conduct free work for Apple in their spare time by auditing their assets. Despite Apple&amp;rsquo;s website claiming the opposite, you&amp;rsquo;ll frequently find things like quiet patching, no credit, no bounties, and an appalling lack of communication.
This is unwise on Apple&amp;rsquo;s part because it frustrates people who find these bugs and disincentivizes them from sharing them with Apple.</description>

      <title>Setting Up a Kernel Debugging Environment</title>

      <description>Following up on my first blog post, I&amp;rsquo;ve received a few requests to write about setting up a debugging environment; however, since everybody uses different emulators and so on, I&amp;rsquo;ll mainly focus on which config options are useful!
You must first obtain the kernel sources for your preferred version before you can set up a kernel suitable for debugging. We&amp;rsquo;ll have to decompress it after that.
# use your preferred version $ wget https://git.</description>

      <title>An introduction to Kernel Exploitation Part 1</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m writing this post because I often hear that kernel exploitation is intimidating or difficult to learn. As a result, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to start a series of basic bugs and exercises to get you started!
Prerequisites
 Knowledge of the Linux command line Knowing how to read and write basic C may be beneficial Being able to debug with the help of a virtual computer or another system Able to install the kernel module compilation build requirements A basic understanding of the difference between userland and kernelland could be helpful Having a basic understanding of assembly can be beneficial for future episodes  For this part, I wrote a simple Linux character device, /dev/shell.</description>
