      <description>Earlier this year, I discovered a flaw in XNU, which is the kernel that Apple uses. And while it&amp;rsquo;s not a particularly complicated flaw, I wanted to explain how I discovered it and how it works, both so that I can motivate others and so that others can learn from my discovery.
Within the memdev.c file (the ramdisk device driver), I found the source of the issue, which was a write/read operation that exceeded the allowed range.</description>

      <description>Mistreatment by Apple Security is unfortunately something you&amp;rsquo;re likely to come across on a regular basis. Usually this concerns people that conduct free work for Apple in their spare time by auditing their assets. Despite Apple&amp;rsquo;s website claiming the opposite, you&amp;rsquo;ll frequently find things like quiet patching, no credit, no bounties, and an appalling lack of communication.
This is unwise on Apple&amp;rsquo;s part because it frustrates people who find these bugs and disincentivizes them from sharing them with Apple.</description>
