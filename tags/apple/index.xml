      <description>Mistreatment by Apple Security is unfortunately something you&amp;rsquo;re likely to come across on a regular basis. Usually this concerns people that conduct free work for Apple in their spare time by auditing their assets. Despite Apple&amp;rsquo;s website claiming the opposite, you&amp;rsquo;ll frequently find things like quiet patching, no credit, no bounties, and an appalling lack of communication.
This is unwise on Apple&amp;rsquo;s part because it frustrates people who find these bugs and disincentivizes them from sharing them with Apple.</description>
