      <description>Following up on my first blog post, I&amp;rsquo;ve received a few requests to write about setting up a debugging environment; however, since everybody uses different emulators and so on, I&amp;rsquo;ll mainly focus on which config options are useful!
You must first obtain the kernel sources for your preferred version before you can set up a kernel suitable for debugging. We&amp;rsquo;ll have to decompress it after that.
# use your preferred version $ wget https://git.</description>

      <title>An introduction to Kernel Exploitation Part 1</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m writing this post because I often hear that kernel exploitation is intimidating or difficult to learn. As a result, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to start a series of basic bugs and exercises to get you started!
Prerequisites
 Knowledge of the Linux command line Knowing how to read and write basic C may be beneficial Being able to debug with the help of a virtual computer or another system Able to install the kernel module compilation build requirements A basic understanding of the difference between userland and kernelland could be helpful Having a basic understanding of assembly can be beneficial for future episodes  For this part, I wrote a simple Linux character device, /dev/shell.</description>

      <description>The following are some of the bugs I discovered:
2021  CVE-2021-3177: Python 3.x through 3.9.1 has a buffer overflow in PyCArg_repr in _ctypes/callproc.c, which may lead to remote code execution in certain Python applications that accept floating-point numbers as untrusted input, as demonstrated by a 1e300 argument to c_double.from_param. This occurs because sprintf is used unsafely.  2020   CVE-2020-12105: OpenConnect through 8.08 mishandles negative return values from X509_check_ function calls, which allows an attacker that is able to get valid certificates from a CA with a specially crafted CommonName to perform a person-in-the-middle attack against VPN clients.</description>
